# HTML

## HTML Tags

- Heading elements - `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>`

> [!TIP]
> It is a good practise to have only one `<h1>` on a web page.

- Text elements -
  - Bold - `<strong>`
  - Italic - `<em>`

> [!TIP] > `<b>` is also used to bold text and similarly, `<i>` for italic text but they are deprecated in favor of "semantic" html.
