# Availability

- Percentage of time a service or infrastructure is accessible and operates normally.
- Measuring availability -
$$
A(\%) = \frac{\text{Total Time} - \text{Downtime}}{\text{Total Time}} \times 100
$$



- Higher A â†’ better availability.
- We measure availability as a number of nines, eg -
    - 90% (1 nine) - Downtime/Year = 36.5 days
    - 99% (2 nines) - Downtime/Year = 3.65 days
    - 99.5% - Downtime/Year = 1.83 days
    - 99.9% (3 nines) - Downtime/Year = 8.76 hrs
    - 99.999% (5 nines) - Downtime/Year = 5.26 mins
    - 99.99999% (7 nines) - Downtime/Year = 3.15 secs

> [!NOTE]
> Different providers measure availability differently. Always understand how a provider calculates availability before relying on it.
