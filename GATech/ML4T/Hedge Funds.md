- How are the fund managers are compensated -
    - ETFs - 
        - compensated using _expense ratio_ which is a percentage (0.01% to 0.1%) of AUM.
        - ETFs are usually tied to an index.
        - Expenditure issues are usually pretty low.
    - Mutual funds - 
        - _expense ratio_ is 0.5% to 3% of AUM.
        - Mutual fund management requires more skills, therefore the percentage is higher.
    - Hedge funds -
        - compensated using _two and twenty_ model - 2% of AUM (before (usually) or after adding the profit - dependent on the fund) plus 20% of the profits.
