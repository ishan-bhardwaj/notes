## Operating System

- **An Operating System** is a piece of software that _abstracts_ and _arbitrates_ the underlying hardware system.
- _Abstraction_ means simplifying what the hardware actually looks like. Eg - supporting different types of speaker, interchangeable access of hard disk or SSD.
- _Arbitration_ means to control the hardware components. Eg - distributing memory between multiple processes
- An Operating system is a layer of system softwares that - 
    - has direct priviledged access to the underlying hardware.
    - hides the hardware complexity.
    - manages hardware on behalf of one or more applications according to some predefined policies.
    - ensures that applications are isolated and protected from one another.

> [!TIP]
> Cache memory is used by OS and applications for performance, but it is actually managed by the hardware itself. So, it is not considered as a component of OS.

- OS elements -
    - _Abstractions_ - process, thread, file, socket, memory page etc.
    - _Mechanisms_ - create, schedule, open, write, allocate etc.
    - _Policies_ - least recently used (LRU), earliest deadline first (EDF) etc.
